This branch will be delted later. For this branch to work meteor has to be reseted. Also, I was not able to add mongo a way to stop duplicates. So if you get errors saying theres duplicate, try reseting metoer. The collection was altered here a bit.

The collection seems to be displaying now, in minimongo the data is appearing whne you log in and go to the data page. Feel free to use this as the new issue 26 or copy paste the changes i made into issue 26 and i will delete this branch later.
